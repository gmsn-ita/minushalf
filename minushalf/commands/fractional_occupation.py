    Perform fractional occupation on the atom and generate the potential for this occupation.
    The occupation can subtract any fraction of the electron between 0 and 0.5, half occupation is the default.

    Requires:

        ORBITAL_QUANTUM_NUMBER: A string that defines the orbital(s) in which the occupation will be made,
        it can assume four values: (0: s | 1: p | 2: d | 3: f). if going to modify multiple orbitals,
        pass a string with numbers separated by commas : ("0,1,2,3").


        OCCUPATION_PERCENTAGE: A string that defines percentual of half an electron to be used in the occupation.
        The default is 100%, which states for 0.5e. For multiple occupations in different orbitals, pass a string
        separated by commas ("100,50,40,100"). For simplicity, to avoid the excessive repetition of the number
        100, just replace the number with * ("*,30,*"). If this argument is not used, the occupation of
        half an electron will be made for all orbitals assed as arguments.


        INP: Input file of the run-atomic command.

    Returns:

        INP_OCC : Input file modified for fractional occupation.


        INP.ae: A copy of the input file for the calculation.


        VTOTAL_OCC: Contains the atom potential for fractional occupation.


        OUT: Contains detailed information about the run.


        AECHARGE: Contains in four columns values of r, the “up” and “down” parts of the total
        charge density, and the total core charge density (the charges multiplied by 4πr 2 ).


        CHARGE: is exactly identical to AECHARGE and is generated for backwards compatibility.


        RHO: Like CHARGE, but without the 4πr 2 factor


        AEWFNR0...AEWFNR3: All-electron valence wavefunctions as function of radius, for s, p, d,
        and f valence orbitals (0, 1, 2, 3, respectively — some channels might not be available).
        They include a factor of r, the s orbitals also going to zero at the origin.
