DFT -1/2 technique
-----------------------
DFT-1/2, an alternative way of referring to the LDA -1/2 [1]_ [2]_ and GGA -1/2 [2]_ techniques, 
is a method that performs semiconductor band-gap calculations with precision close 
to the state of the art algorithms [2]_. These technique aim to expand the half-occupation 
technique [3]_ [4]_ [5]_, formalized by Janak's theorem, to crystals using modern exchange-correlation approaches [6]_ [7]_.

The intuition of the method comes from the premise that the energy bands of a crystal are formed by the 
overlap of atomic orbitals [8]_, especially those that make up the outmost layers. This influence can 
be quantified by the projection of the wave function in a given orbital, figure 1 shows the result of these projections in VBM and CBM for ZnO. 
Thus, corrections used 
for ionization energy calculations or electronic affinity in atoms could propagate and result in a 
Gap correction for crystalline systems, since they directly influence the energy level of the orbitals [1]_.







DFT -1/2 results
----------------------

The results obtained by the application the method has the same precision [2]_ as the GW [9]_ algorithm , considered 
the state of the art for calculating the band-gap of semiconductors. In addition, the computational complexity of the method 
is equivalent to calculating the Khon-Shan gap, which allows the technique to be applied to complex systems.
